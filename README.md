# Emoji Manager

Propose, vote, and upload custom Slack emoji with Emoji Manager ðŸŽ‰.

With `@Emoji Manager`, a Slack user proposes an emoji, the community votes on it, and approved emoji are automatically uploaded to Slack. We created `@Emoji Manager` to bridge a gap in the Slack emoji management process.
Natively, Slack provides 2 primary options for setting custom emoji:

* Allow anyone to upload anything as an emoji
* Only give a select group (like admins) the ability to upload an emoji

Each of these have some problems, and neither encourage a good community interaction. `@Emoji Manager` creates an environment with simple rules, broad engagement and is self-governing.

We wrote a blog post about the importance of custom emoji here: https://tech.target.com/blog/custom-emoji-management
