## Integrate Creative Cloud Libraries into your apps

With the Creative Cloud Libraries API you can connect your application to Libraries and expand the reach of your users' creative systems. This helps them work more efficiently by providing access to their creative elements inside your application and connecting your application back to Creative Cloud products.

- [Check out the Creative Cloud Libraries API](../creative-cloud-libraries)

# The Creative Cloud Developer Community

Multiple focuses. Many identities. A singular mission to empower creatives.

![MSFT Teams logo](images/dev-days.jpg)

### Multiple focuses

Some Creative Cloud developers focus on building plugins and scripts for a single Creative Cloud app, others build across multiple apps at once. Still others integrate services from Adobe into their own products. And there are even some who do all of these things!

### Many identities

Creative Cloud developers may identify as _developer_, _scripter_, _entrepreneur_, _business owner_, and yes: _creative_ or _artist_. Some have been building with Adobe APIs for many years; others are getting started with their first JavaScript today. They come from all over the world.

No matter their goals or the specifics of the journey that brought them here, Creative Cloud developers are all on a mission to inspire and empower creatives and their teams to get more done in less time, work together in new ways, and push the boundaries of creativity.

### Join the Creative Cloud Developer community
