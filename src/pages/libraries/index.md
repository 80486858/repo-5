# Make your application part of the creative system with the Creative Cloud Libraries API

With the Creative Cloud Libraries API lets you connect your application to your users creative system. Creative Cloud Libraries lets them manage, organize, and keep creative elements like colors, character styles, logos, and images for use in the Creative Cloud tools and connected applications. 

The API lets you give users access to those creative elements and brand approved assets from inside your application or let them easily save elements to a Creative Cloud Library so that they are instantly available for use inside Creative Cloud tools.
